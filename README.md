# core.rrb-vector

An implementation of the confluently persistent vector data structure
introduced in Bagwell, Rompf, "RRB-Trees: Efficient Immutable
Vectors", EPFL-REPORT-169879, September, 2011.

RRB-Trees build upon Clojure's PersistentVectors, adding logarithmic
time concatenation and slicing. ClojureScript is supported with the
same API except for the absence of the `vector-of` function.

The main API entry points are `clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec`,
performing vector concatenation, and `clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec`,
which produces a new vector containing the appropriate subrange of the
input vector (in contrast to `clojure.core/subvec`, which returns a
view on the input vector).

core.rrb-vector's vectors can store objects or unboxed primitives. The
implementation allows for seamless interoperability with
`clojure.lang.PersistentVector`, `clojure.core.Vec` (more commonly
known as gvec) and `clojure.lang.APersistentVector$SubVector`
instances: `clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec` and
`clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec` convert their inputs to
`clojure.core.rrb_vector.rrbt.Vector` instances whenever necessary
(this is a very fast constant time operation for PersistentVector and
gvec; for SubVector it is O(log n), where n is the size of the
underlying vector).

`clojure.core.rrb-vector` also exports its own versions of `vector`,
`vector-of` and `vec` which always produce
`clojure.core.rrb_vector.rrbt.Vector` instances. Note that `vector-of`
accepts `:object` as one of the possible type arguments, in addition
to keywords naming primitive types.

## Usage

core.rrb-vector exports one public namespace:

    (require '[clojure.core.rrb-vector :as fv])

Note that the ClojureScript version uses the same namespace name (it
*does not* use the alternative `cljs.*` prefix!). This is because the
API is precisely the same (except `clojure.core.rrb-vector/vector-of`
only makes sense on the JVM and is therefore not available in
ClojureScript).

The docstring attached to the namespace provides an overview of the
available functionality (as found at the top of this README):

    (doc clojure.core.rrb-vector)

The new functionality is accessible through two functions:
`clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec`, which provides logarithmic-time
non-view slicing (in contrast to `clojure.core/subvec`, which is a
constant-time operation producing view vectors that prevent the
underlying vector from becoming eligible for garbage collection), and
`clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec`, which provides logarithmic-time
concatenation. Crucially, these can be applied to regular
Clojure(Script) vectors.

    (doc fv/subvec)
    (doc fv/catvec)

    ;; apply catvec and subvec to regular Clojure(Script) vectors
    (fv/catvec (vec (range 1234)) (vec (range 8765)))
    (fv/subvec (vec (range 1024)) 123 456)

Additionally, several functions for constructing RRB vectors are
provided. There is rarely any reason to use them, since, as mentioned
above, the interesting functions exported by core.rrb-vector work with
regular vectors. Note that `clojure.core.rrb-vector/vec`, in contrast
to `clojure.core/vec`, reuses the internal tree of its input if it
already is a vector (of any type) and does not alias short arrays.
When passed a non-vector argument, it returns an RRB vector.

    (doc fv/vector)
    (doc fv/vector-of)
    (doc fv/vec)

The debug namespace bundled with core.rrb-vector provides several
utilities used by the test suite, as well as a function for
visualizing the internal structure of vectors that works with regular
Clojure(Script) vectors and RRB vectors.

    ;; for peeking under the hood
    (require '[clojure.core.rrb-vector.debug :as dv])
    (dv/dbg-vec (fv/catvec (vec (range 1234)) (vec (range 8765))))

## TODO

 1. more tests;

 2. benchmarks;

 3. performance: general perf tuning, more efficient `catvec`
    implementation (to replace current seq-ops-based impl).

## Releases and dependency information

core.rrb-vector requires Clojure >= 1.5.0. View vectors created by
`clojure.core/subvec` are correctly handled for Clojure >= 1.6.0. The
ClojureScript version is regularly tested against the most recent
ClojureScript release.

core.rrb-vector releases are available from Maven Central. Development
snapshots are available from the Sonatype OSS repository.

## Developer information

core.rrb-vector is being developed as a Clojure Contrib project, see
the
[What is Clojure Contrib](http://dev.clojure.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5767464)
page for details. Patches will only be accepted from developers who
have signed the Clojure Contributor Agreement.

### Useful Maven commands

To run Clojure and ClojureScript tests:
```bash
$ mvn -DCLOJURE_VERSION=1.10.1 -Dclojure.version=1.10.1 clean test
```

Clojure versions as old as 1.5.1 can be tested with such a command,
but the ClojureScript tests only work when using Clojure 1.8.0 or
later.

To run tests and, if successful, create a JAR file in the targets
directory:
```bash
$ mvn -DCLOJURE_VERSION=1.10.1 -Dclojure.version=1.10.1 clean package
```


### Useful Leiningen commands

To run Clojure tests, but no ClojureScript tests:
```bash
$ lein with-profile +1.10 test
```
You can test with Clojure versions 1.6 through 1.10 by specifying that
version number after the `+`.  You can test with Clojure 1.5.1 using
`lein test`.

To run ClojureScript tests with Node.js and Spidermonkey JavaScript
runtimes, but no Clojure tests:
```bash
$ lein with-profile +cljs cljsbuild test
```
Add `nodejs` or `spidermonkey` as a separate argument after `test` to
restrict the JavaScript runtime used to only the one you specify.  You
may need to adjust the command names in the `:test-commands` section
of the `project.clj` file if the command for running those JavaScript
runtimes have a different name on your system than what is used there.

To run normal Clojure tests, plus the collection-check tests, but no
ClojureScript tests:
```bash
$ lein with-profile +coll,+1.7 test
```
The collection-check tests require Clojure 1.7.0 or later, I believe
because collection-check and/or its dependencies require that.

There is no existing command configured to run collection-check tests
with ClojureScript.

To start a REPL from Leiningen with Clojure versions 1.6.0 and older,
you must use Leiningen 2.8.0 (likely some other versions work, too).


## Clojure(Script) code reuse

core.rrb-vector's vectors support the same basic functionality regular
Clojure's vectors do (with the omissions listed above). Where
possible, this is achieved by reusing code from Clojure's gvec and
ClojureScript's PersistentVector implementations. The Clojure(Script)
source files containing the relevant code carry the following
