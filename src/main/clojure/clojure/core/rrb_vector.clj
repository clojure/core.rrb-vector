(ns clojure.core.rrb-vector

  "An implementation of the confluently persistent vector data
  structure introduced in Bagwell, Rompf, \"RRB-Trees: Efficient
  Immutable Vectors\", EPFL-REPORT-169879, September, 2011.

  RRB-Trees build upon Clojure's PersistentVectors, adding logarithmic
  time concatenation and slicing.

  The main API entry points are clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec,
  performing vector concatenation, and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec,
  which produces a new vector containing the appropriate subrange of
  the input vector (in contrast to clojure.core/subvec, which returns
  a view on the input vector).

  core.rrb-vector's vectors can store objects or unboxed primitives.
  The implementation allows for seamless interoperability with
  clojure.lang.PersistentVector, clojure.core.Vec (more commonly known
  as gvec) and clojure.lang.APersistentVector$SubVector instances:
  clojure.core.rrb-vector/catvec and clojure.core.rrb-vector/subvec
  convert their inputs to clojure.core.rrb-vector.rrbt.Vector
  instances whenever necessary (this is a very fast constant time
  operation for PersistentVector and gvec; for SubVector it is O(log
  n), where n is the size of the underlying vector).

  clojure.core.rrb-vector also exports its own versions of vector and
  vector-of and vec which always produce
  clojure.core.rrb-vector.rrbt.Vector instances. Note that vector-of
  accepts :object as one of the possible type arguments, in addition
  to keywords naming primitive types."
